# Welcome to webKnossos

webKnossos is an [open-source tool](https://github.com/scalableminds/webknossos) for [exploring](../guides/tracing_ui.md) large 3D electron-microscopy \(EM\) and light-microscopy \(LM\) datasets as well as [collaboratively](../guides/sharing.md) generating annotations. The web-based tool is powered by a specialized data-delivery backend that stores [large datasets](../guides/datasets.md) efficiently on disk and serves many concurrent users. webKnossos has a GPU-accelerated viewer that includes tools for creating and sharing annotations \(skeletons and volumes\). Powerful [user](../guides/users.md) and [task](../guides/tasks.md) management features automatically distribute tasks to human annotators. There are a lot of productivity improvements to make the human part as efficient as possible. webKnossos is also a platform for [showcasing datasets](https://demo.webknossos.org) alongside a paper publication.
